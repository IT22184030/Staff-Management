# IVORY DENTAL CLINIC - Staff Management

IVORY DENTAL CLINIC is a comprehensive dental clinic management system developed as part of my Year 2 Semester 2 group project. My role focused on implementing the Staff Management Function, which is critical for streamlining the operations related to clinic staff, including scheduling, role assignments, and performance tracking.

## Key Features

 -Staff Scheduling: Enables clinic administrators to create, update, and manage staff schedules with ease, ensuring there are no conflicts in shift assignments.
 -Role Assignment: Allows administrators to assign specific roles to staff members (e.g., dentists, assistants, receptionists) and control access to different 
  system functionalities.
 -Staff Performance Tracking: Provides tools to track staff performance, attendance, and workload, making it easier for management to assess and optimize 
  operations.
 -Security: Ensures that staff data is protected with role-based authentication and authorization mechanisms.

##  The project leverages the following technologies:

- **MongoDB**:For efficient storage and management of staff data.
- **Express.js**: To create the backend server and handle API requests related to staff management.
- **React**:  For building a dynamic interface for clinic administrators to manage staff schedules, roles, and performance.
- **Node.js**: As the runtime environment for executing server-side JavaScript.
-
